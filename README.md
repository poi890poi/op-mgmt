# Purpose
In modern organizations there are thousands of routine management tasks. Without standard procedures it's easy to lose track of things or have some requirements left behind. It takes lots of time and workforce to build procedures from scratch. And the quality is usually mediocre. It's difficult to imagine things that haven't happened yet and design procedures to deal with situations with uncertain scopes or scales. This project is initiated to create operational procedure references forâ€¦
- new organizations,
- organizations that have no standard procedures yet,
- organizations that find procedures inadequate regarding quality or coverage.

The idea is to create protocols like in computer science. Protocol is a set of rules or procedures. Different from operational procedures, protocols don't easily change. It evolves slowly over time to ensure its efficiency, compatibility, and interoperability. With the help of Git Workflow, modifications to protocols are reviewed and tracked to maintain high quality and relevance. The project is open for everyone to edit so people from different domains or organizations can contribute to make the protocols complete and inclusive.
# What Is IETF RFC
"The IETF publishes its technical documentation as RFCs, an acronym for their historical title Requests for Comments. They describe the Internet's technical foundations, such as addressing, routing, and transport technologies. RFCs also specify protocols like TLS 1.3, QUIC, and WebRTC that are used to deliver services used by billions of people every day, such as real-time collaboration, email, and the domain name system."
- RFCs are freely available to download, copy, publish, display and distribute, in a variety of formats.
- RFCs are about specifications and standards, not about implementations.
- For example, one can perfectly follow RFC 2616 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 with a pen and paper. IETF actually published an April Fools' Day RFC 1149 IP over Avian Carriers (IPoAC) demonstrating that an internet protocol could be implemented without a network connection.

# One Protocol to Rule Them All
- Protocols must be assigned with serial numbers in increasing order.
- A protocol must have a purpose section.
- A protocol must have a scope section. The scope section describes specific industries or activities which the protocol is to be applied.
- A protocol should have a requirements section specifying its personnel, software, and hardware requirements.
- A protocol should have different levels of complexity and cost. For example, inventory management could be completely manual or could involve software and/or hardware tools.
- A protocol should have different levels of abstraction from high level principles to trivial physical implementations.
- A protocol should be universal unless being specified otherwise. That means a protocol should not have contents for specific countries or cultures.
- A protocol should list references including: ISO standards, IEC standards, or other protocols in this project.
- RFCs could supersede others; the superseded RFCs are said to be deprecated, obsolete, or obsoleted by the superseding RFC.
- Protocols must follow the version control mechanism of GitHub.
